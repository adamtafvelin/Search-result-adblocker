# Search-result-adblocker
Extremely simple Firefox adblocker that removes the links which are classified as ads in the search result of Duckduckgo. 

## Why?
Because I was bored.

## Why not use a normal ad blocker?
These are often very bloated with additional functionality which I dont want.

## Why limit to only Firefox and duckduckgo?
This is what I personally use and if you want support for more search engines, simply edit the manifet.json.
