# Search-result-adblocker
Extremely simple Firefox adblocker that removes the links which are classified as ads in the search result of Duckduckgo. 

# How to use / install
1. Clone the repo
2. Open about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox in Firefox. (use the search bar)
3. Select "Load temporary add-on..."
4. Select the manifest.json file.
5. Profit!

## Why?
Because I was bored.

## Why not use a normal ad blocker?
These are often very bloated with additional functionality which I dont want.

## Why limit to only Firefox and duckduckgo?
This is what I personally use and if you want support for more search engines, simply edit the manifest.json.
